\title{Extending rowData}
\usage{
lookup_in(sce, exp_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment object}

\item{exp_type}{either "WTA" or "Amplicon" depending on the used experiments technology}
}
\value{
SingleCellAlleleExperiment object with extended rowData
}
\description{
Internal function used in the \code{SingleCellAlleleExperiment()} constructor adding information to the SingleCellAlleleExperiment object by
extending the rowData by two columns. "NI_I" is a classifier for each feature_row if its considered a
non-immune (NI) or immune (I) gene. "Quant_type" is a classifier for determinig which row is related to which
subassay of the extended main assay in the SingleCellAlleleExperiment. "A" corresponds to allele, "G" to allele gene and
""F" to functional allele class.
