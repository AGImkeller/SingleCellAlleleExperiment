Description: 
  Defines a S4 class that is based on SingleCellExperiment. In addition to the usual gene layer
  the object can also store data for immune genes such as HLAs, Igs and KIRs at allele and functional level.
  The package is part of a workflow named single-cell ImmunoGenomic Diversity (scIGD), that firstly incoporates allele-aware quantification data for immune genes.
  This new data can then be used with the here implemented datastructure and functionalities for further data handling and data analysis.
